# APK Raccoon Severity Definitions
# Used by all scanners to ensure consistent severity classification

severity_levels:
  Critical:
    rank: 1
    description: "Immediate exploitation risk requiring urgent remediation"
    examples:
      - "Hardcoded secrets/API keys in source code"
      - "Disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation"
      - "Empty TrustManager or HostnameVerifier"
      - "SQL injection vulnerabilities"
      - "Command injection vulnerabilities"
    action: "Fix immediately before release"

  High:
    rank: 2
    description: "Significant security weakness with clear attack vector"
    examples:
      - "Weak cryptography (DES, ECB mode, RC2)"
      - "Exported components with sensitive permissions"
      - "Cleartext HTTP traffic to non-local hosts"
      - "WebView with JavaScript enabled and file access"
      - "Weak PBKDF2 iterations (<10000)"
      - "Insecure WebSocket connections (ws://)"
    action: "Fix before production release"

  Medium:
    rank: 3
    description: "Moderate risk requiring attention in security review"
    examples:
      - "Debug flags enabled (android:debuggable)"
      - "Backup enabled without encryption"
      - "MD5/SHA1 for security purposes"
      - "Missing binary protections (root detection, etc.)"
      - "Static IV in encryption"
      - "StrictMode or debug code in production"
      - "DWARF debug sections in native libs"
    action: "Address before release, document if accepted"

  Low:
    rank: 4
    description: "Minor issues or best practice violations"
    examples:
      - "Verbose logging statements"
      - "Unstripped native library symbols"
      - "Missing certificate pinning (defense in depth)"
      - "Code appears unobfuscated"
      - "System.out/err print statements"
    action: "Consider fixing, lower priority"

  Info:
    rank: 5
    description: "Informational observation, not a vulnerability"
    examples:
      - "FLAG_SECURE protection detected (positive)"
      - "Root detection present (positive)"
      - "Certificate pinning implemented (positive)"
      - "Split APK detected (metadata)"
